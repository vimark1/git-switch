# git-switch

Switch between your most used branches

`git switch` is a simple git utility to let you swicth branches in a project.
The nice thing about it, is that it let's you pick from a list of recently used
branchs, rather than all your 100+ branches.

## Install

You can simply download the scripts in anyway you like and make sure to put the
program into your `$PATH`

## Usage

```bash

# On any git repository
$ git switch
```
